# AIRR Programme Summary

[📄 Main AIRR Overview](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-research-resource/airr-advanced-supercomputers-for-the-uk)

## What is AIRR?

The AI Research Resource (AIRR) is a government-funded programme providing world-leading AI-specialised computing capacity to UK public researchers, academia, and SMEs. It addresses the under-provision of specialised public compute for AI R&D and supports the government's growth agenda. The government has committed over £350 million by 2030 and aims to expand AIRR capacity by at least 20x by 2030 (as announced in the [AI Opportunities Action Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan)).

## Compute Clusters

Two major facilities are available:

- **Isambard-AI** (University of Bristol): UK's most powerful public compute facility with 5,448 Nvidia GH200 Grace-Hopper superchips
  - [Isambard Documentation](https://docs.isambard.ac.uk/)
- **Dawn** (University of Cambridge): 1,024 Intel Data Centre GPU Max 1550 GPUs
  - [Dawn Documentation](https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/d-w-n)

## Three Access Routes

All routes are rolling (no closing dates) except Innovator's current deadline of 16 January 2026. Projects must be UK-based and deliver UK benefits. Access follows Subsidy Control Act 2022 requirements.

### 1. Rapid Access Route

- **Target**: UK-registered micro/small/medium businesses only
- **Resources**: Up to 20,000 GPU hours, used within 3 months
- **Eligible activities**: Feasibility studies, industrial research, experimental development
- **Purpose**: Quick access for early-stage AI product development prior to market launch
- **Assessment**: Light-touch monthly review by UKRI/DSIT team, max 2 months to access

### 2. Gateway Route

[📄 Gateway Route Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-research-resource/airr-gateway-route-ukri-guidance)

- **Target**: First-time AI supercomputing users from academia, industry, or other UK organisations
- **Resources**: Up to 10,000 GPU hours, used within 3 months
- **Eligible activities**: Fundamental research (research orgs only), feasibility studies, industrial research, experimental development
- **Purpose**: Testing/benchmarking novel algorithms, code, and workflows before larger applications
- **Assessment**: Light-touch monthly review, max 2 months to access

### 3. Innovator Route

[📄 Innovator Route Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-research-resource/airr-innovator-route-ukri-guidance)

- **Target**: Larger ambitious projects with research teams/partnerships from academia, industry, or other UK organisations
- **Resources**: 50,000-150,000 GPU hours, used within 6 months
- **Deadline**: 4pm, 16 January 2026 (project starts Feb-March 2026)
- **Eligible activities**: Same as Gateway
- **Purpose**: Novel algorithm development, AI-assisted workflows, AI-driven data activities, early-stage product development
- **Requirement**: Applicants expected to have prior Gateway award (or first month treated as assessment period)
- **Assessment**: Peer review by two experts; applications tiered with partial randomisation for resource allocation
- **Focus areas**: Projects contributing to government's five missions (economy, NHS, safer streets, opportunity, clean energy)

## Key Eligibility Requirements

All routes accept UK organisations including businesses (with Companies House number), charities, not-for-profits, and [UKRI-eligible research organisations](https://www.ukri.org/publications/organisation-eligibility/research-organisations-eligible-for-ukri-funding/).

Non-academic organisations must:
- State all eligible project costs (no funding provided, only compute resources) - see [UKRI costs guidance](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/costs-we-fund/costs-guidance-for-non-academic-organisations/)
- Meet support ratios: compute resources can cover 25-70% of total project costs (varies by organisation size and activity type)
- Costs welcomed: software development, AI-related staff training
- Comply with [Subsidy Control Act 2022](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/23/enacted)

For more information on research categories, see [UKRI categories of research and development](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/general-guidance/categories-of-research-and-development/).

## Application Process via AIRRPortal
