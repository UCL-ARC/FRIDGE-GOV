Capability Requirement: Standardisation

Objective

Ensure consistency, interoperability, and fairness across the federation by applying shared standards for terminology, processes, training, data, and outputs. Standardisation enables researchers, auditors, and the public to engage with the federation as a unified system, while allowing members to retain domain-specific flexibility.



Capability Description

The federation must establish and maintain a baseline of standardisation across members. This includes standard terms, processes, and data formats, as well as common approaches to training, accreditation, and output checking. Standardisation should prevent inconsistency or confusion, while not imposing unnecessary burdens that undermine member autonomy or productivity.



Terminology \& Roles



Federation must define and adopt standard terms for key roles (e.g., researcher, analyst, output checker).

Members must use terms consistently, supported by a federation-wide glossary.

Processes \& Agreements



Federation must define standard operating procedures (SOPs) for:

Data access processes, Output review and classification

Data classification, environment tiering

Federation must provide standard legal/administrative templates:



DPIAs

Data sharing agreements

Collaboration agreements

Training \& Certification



Federation must establish a baseline training standard for researchers.

Training provided by one member must be recognised as equivalent across the federation.

Training status shared through api etc

Outputs \& Observability



Federation must define a single, consistent system for output classification and release.

Federation must apply common approaches to reviewing AI/ML outputs.

Tools \& Interfaces



Federation should provide a common baseline of tools and interfaces for researchers.

Federation must define the minimum standardisation required, while allowing members to customise TREs for specific domains.
