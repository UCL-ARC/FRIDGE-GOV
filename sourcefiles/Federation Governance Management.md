\### Detail



\*\*Capability Description\*\*



The federation must establish a governance framework that defines membership, rules, responsibilities, and accountability. Governance should balance central authority with local autonomy, ensuring clarity for members, researchers, stakeholders, and the public.



Membership \& Accreditation

\- Each federation member must publish accreditation status, certifications, and compliance information to other members.

\- The federation must make its membership standards (rules, accreditations, entry requirements) publicly available.



Authority \& Rules

\- The federation must make shared rules clear and accessible to all members. The federation must publish a shared responsibility model summarising  accountability for different elements 

The governance model must specify when authority rests with a central federation body versus with individual members.

\- Federation rules must ensure consistent treatment of stakeholders, researchers, and data owners.



Oversight \& Accountability

\- The federation must define how auditing, scrutiny, and regulatory oversight are applied across members.

\- Federation governance could provide a single point of oversight for external entities, or a common oversight approach agreed across members.

\- Each member must be available for scrutiny by others in the federation.



Costing \& Fairness

\- The federation must ensure fair and transparent pricing models across members.

\- Governance must prevent confusing or unfair billing practices (e.g., unexpected multiple invoices).



Public Accountability

\- The federation must adopt a standard for public communication on what data is held, and how it is used.

\- Governance must include mechanisms for ongoing public engagement (e.g., PPIE groups, public panels).

\- The federation should routinely review public trust in its purpose and adapt governance accordingly.
