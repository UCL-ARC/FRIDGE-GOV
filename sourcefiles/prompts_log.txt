FRIDGE Project - User Prompts Log
===================================

Prompt 1:
I am working on a project called FRIDGE FRIDGE: Federated Research Infrastructure by Data Governance Extension. Using sensitive data to develop AI models involves carefully isolating parts of large AI supercomputers as Trusted Research Environments (TREs) so that only approved researchers can safely access them for their research. FRIDGE aims to explore this possibility by creating a ready-to-use TRE that meets the SATRE specification (developed as part of the DARE UK Phase 1 Driver Projects and enhanced by TREvolution) on the AIRR. This will enable the secure use of sensitive data to develop AI models for research that benefits the public while ensuring strict information governance.The TRE will be deployed across AIRR supercomputing systems, Dawn (Cambridge) and Isambard-AI (Bristol) and compatible with public cloud platforms, Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. Approved researchers will be able to access the TRE and analyse sensitive health data, which will help test and improve the TRE capabilities they use in a real-world setting.By establishing a robust governance framework, FRIDGE will enable AIRR to host secure TREs, ensuring that large-scale AI research can operate within secure, compliant environments and providing a testbed for other TREvolution capabilities.By the end of the project, FRIDGE will:Deliver a SATRE and NHS standards-compliant, cross-platform TRE on AIRR for AI-driven research using sensitive data.Enable secure isolation of AIRR computing resources, ensuring only authorised researchers access sensitive data under approved governance frameworks.Publish openly accessible software, legal agreements, and policies, allowing other research projects to deploy sensitive data securely on AIRR or similar supercomputing platforms.Establish AIRR TRE as a platform for testing and validating TREvolution capabilities within large-scale AI environments.

Prompt 2:
For each prompt I make can you appent a file in the source files directory with my prompt please


Prompt 3:
I need to write up some processes which would be standardised across all implementers of FRIDGE. we are targeting the UK national computing nfrastrctures AIRR. I would like design a standardised process for safe projects. This has 3 organisations (resource allocator) and TRE operator and Data provider. you can find the roles in the FRIDGE governance extension architecture markdown


Prompt 4:
The safe project process is initiated by a principle investigator the data provider reviews the application and approves. the PI signs an atestation or agreement and gets access to data.


Prompt 5:
metadata is passed to a paralelle process for resource allocation on the FRIDGE hosting facility which is reviewed by the resource allocator. if the project is approved for use of the fridge host resource is allocated. Data and project space is then created on the hosting platform and access provided via a front door TRE


Prompt 6:
can you do me a mermaid diagram?


Prompt 7:
Where you have 2.3 research onboarding. this is a separate process.


Prompt 9:
Step 2.1 and step 2.2 are in the wrong order. Front Door TRE provisioning should be first


Prompt 10:
SAFE is not  an acronym but a proper noun just capitalise the first letter


Prompt 11:
There is another organisation to be included the FRIDGE Hosting org. Their key activities are provisioning and securing of resources


Prompt 12:
can you change all spellings to UK english


Prompt 13:
create a folder at the root called docs and move FRIDGE_Governance_Extension_Architecture.md and sourcefiles\FRIDGE_SAFE_Project_Process.md into it


Prompt 14:
move the FRIDGE_Images into the docs folder and update all the links so the images still work


Prompt 15:
I need to document a basic Safe Researcher process. create a new file in a similar format to docs\FRIDGE_SAFE_Project_Process.md and document the safe researcher process. use the contents of this document. The main steps are attestattion and training safe researchers are approved by the data provider or they may delegate this responsibilityto the TRE provider


Prompt 16:
this shold be more consice, just include critical information


Prompt 17:
The TRE operator mainly just checks the approvals and provides authentication information


Prompt 18:
at the top of the documentation put target duration 48 hours for the whole process


Prompt 19:
Now create one for Safe Setting Process. Main roles will be TRE operator that will submit a request to host a TRE on the FRIDGE hosting platform they will provide information on the pattern they are planning to use - FRIDGE remote job submission TRE or Full Stack TRE. The FRIDGE Hostig org and the Resource allocation org will apporve. There will bea test deployment using non-sensitive data, an audit and pen test and then approval from resource allocator and FRIDGE ostig org. This process only needs to be done once when the TRE operator first uses fridge or if they change the pattern being deployed


Prompt 20:
remove step 5 to simplify


Prompt 21:
update docs\FRIDGE_Governance_Extension_Architecture.md with all the roles added to the other docs in the Roles Catalogue table


Prompt 22:
I need to link the establishment of boundaries in this document docs\FRIDGE_Governance_Extension_Architecture.md to the process that establishes them


Prompt 23:
in the Safe project process add pre-requisits "Safe Setting Process complete 


Prompt 24:
Now make links in the processes to the realevant roles and boundaries sections in the docs\FRIDGE_Governance_Extension_Architecture.md doc


Prompt 25:
create a new doc called Governing_FRIDGE move section 3 from docs\FRIDGE_Governance_Extension_Architecture.md into it and use all the content in this doc and the processes to summarise  hiearchical structure with top management at the top and an operational management group underneath made up of the resource allocator, FRDIGE hosting org, TRE operator, Data provider and information goverance people


Prompt 26:
create me a mermaid digram describing the structure in section 4


Prompt 27:
simplify that mermaid diagram. remove the processes and just show the relationships between the groups.


Prompt 28:
I don;t want to define how often anyone meets. take out anything specifiying monthly etc


Prompt 29:
in the mermaid digram in section 4 remove all the escalation lines from the blu boxes and just have 1 from the yellow box


Prompt 30:
Create an implementation guide in a new document starting wit hforming governance and then establishing the processes.


Prompt 31:
the "safe" processes are well documented elsewhere reduce these to very short summaries in the implmentation guide with links to the main process docs


Prompt 32:
remove all the timings


Prompt 33:
create an executive summary in README.md summarising all the content. add a table with links to all the documents and a brief description. also add information about the creation of this repo with me as author at UCL and links to the relevant external site


Prompt 34:
add the alan turinginstitute ti the project partners


Prompt 35:
remove **UCL Research IT Services:** and replace with Advanced Research Computing Centre | Advanced Research Computing - UCL – University College London 


Prompt 36:
I would like to move the process flow digrams to the top of each of the process pages and renumber


Prompt 37:
do the same with the safe researcher and projects process docs


Prompt 38:
reduce section 5  of docs\FRIDGE_Implementation_Guide.md to a brief summary


Prompt 39:
in the implementation guide the safe researcher process is listed as phase 4. this should actually be a phase 0. it is likely to be in place already and used by the data provider, tre provider org or both. can you change the implementation guide and process doc to reflext this


Prompt 40:
make the safe researcher process section in the implementation guide aligned to the other processes and make it shorter. it should have an objecitve section not overview


Prompt 41:
re-order the Roles Catalogue in the following way. TRE Operator org, fridge hosting org, information asset owner, resource allocator, top management, PI, Data consumer, Safe researcher, job submitter and add a key starting with R01


Prompt 42:
add a definition for the Operational Management group from the docs\Governing_FRIDGE.md document into the roles catalogue table in docs\FRIDGE_Governance_Extension_Architecture.md after Top management and before PI


Prompt 43:
add links to tyhe relevant processes to the table


Prompt 44:
re-number 2. Boundaries to 3 as I have added a section


Prompt 45:
ensure numbering is correct in docs\FRIDGE_SAFE_Project_Process.md


Prompt 46:
this section isn;t correct. ## 5. Governance Processes. This should briefly describe the process for setting up governance rather than the processes described in the rest of the repo. so, identify sponsorship within the data provider / asset owner org, TRE operator org and fridge hosting org, identify a risk framework and the establishment of the groups themselves


Prompt 47:
Make this section shorter with brief descriptions of the stages


Prompt 48:
move the diagram in docs\FRIDGE_Implementation_Guide.md to the  into the overview sction and renumber
