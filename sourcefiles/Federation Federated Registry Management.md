\### Summary



Should we include "Federation Registry Management" as a capability?



\### Source



UKTRE Workshop on federation



\### Detail



A theme around central registries emerged from discussion.



Capability: Federated/Central Registry



Objective

Enable discovery, transparency, and trust across a federated network of environments by providing accessible, reliable registries that balance central oversight with member autonomy.



Capability Description

The federation must provide a registry capability that allows participants to:

\- Discover available datasets, services, and outputs across all federation members.

\- Access accreditation status, standards, and compliance information for each member.

\- Maintain public trust by publishing accessible information on data use, outputs, and governance.



This capability can be delivered through a hybrid registry model:

\- A central metadata catalogue that provides a searchable, federation-wide index.

\- Federated local registries maintained by each member, exposing metadata to researchers

\-

Functional Requirements

Data Discovery

\- Federation provide a searchable catalogue of metadata across all members.

\- Metadata entries must be harmonised to a common schema/standard.



Transparency \& Accreditation

\- Each federation member must register accreditation status, standards, and compliance artefacts in the registry.

\- Registry must support external access (e.g., public communication portals).



Outputs \& Provenance

\- Federation must maintain a registry of research outputs, with clear attribution of originating environment.

\- Registry must support consistent classification of data and outputs



Observability \& Auditing

\- Register of projects

\- Federation must provide registry entries for project logs, digital footprints, and oversight records, made available for audit 

\- Registry must support cross-member auditability and scrutiny.



Public Engagement

\- Federation must publish registry information on data use, purpose, and outputs in a form accessible to non-specialists.

\- Federation should provide mechanisms for PPIE/public panels to review registry contents.
